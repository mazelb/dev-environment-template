# Archived Documentation

This folder contains design documents and references that were used during initial development but are no longer actively maintained. They are preserved for historical reference and context.

## Contents

### MULTI_ARCHETYPE_COMPOSITION_DESIGN.md
**Date:** November 19, 2025  
**Status:** Design Complete - Implementation integrated into ARCHETYPE_GUIDE.md

Comprehensive technical design document (~2177 lines) for the multi-archetype composition system. This document contains:
- Detailed conflict resolution algorithms
- Port offsetting and service namespacing strategies
- Archetype metadata schema definitions
- Implementation architecture and examples

**Relevant for:**
- Understanding the original design rationale
- Reference for advanced archetype development
- Conflict resolution implementation details

**Active Documentation:** See [ARCHETYPE_GUIDE.md](../ARCHETYPE_GUIDE.md) for user-facing archetype usage

### NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md
**Date:** Project inception  
**Status:** Conventions established and followed throughout codebase

Standardized naming conventions document that defined:
- Shell script naming (kebab-case.sh)
- Bash function naming (snake_case)
- Docker container naming patterns
- Python module conventions
- Configuration file standards

**Relevant for:**
- Historical reference for naming decisions
- Onboarding contributors who want to understand conventions
- Maintaining consistency in new contributions

**Active Documentation:** Naming patterns are documented inline in:
- [QUICK_START.md](../QUICK_START.md) - Basic conventions
- [TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md](../TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md) - Service naming
- [ARCHETYPE_GUIDE.md](../ARCHETYPE_GUIDE.md) - Archetype naming

## Why Archived?

These documents were archived because:

1. **MULTI_ARCHETYPE_COMPOSITION_DESIGN.md**
   - Implementation is complete and integrated
   - Key concepts summarized in ARCHETYPE_GUIDE.md
   - Too detailed for day-to-day usage
   - Better preserved as design reference

2. **NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md**
   - Conventions are now established and followed
   - Documented implicitly in code and active docs
   - Not frequently referenced by users
   - Better integrated into relevant guides
